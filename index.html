<h1>How to Fork a GitHub Repository</h1>
<div class="content">
  Forking a repo is simple and can be done in just a few clicks. To fork a repo, log in to your account and then go to the repository you want to fork. In the top-right corner of the window, you’ll see a “Fork” button with a number to the right of it, which represents the number of times the repository has been forked. Go ahead and click that button.



  A message will briefly appear letting you know that the forking process has started. It only takes a few seconds to fork the repo.
  
  That’s all there is to it. It’s that easy.
  
  You’re now safe to make any changes to the code in your forked repository that you like. To do so, just clone the forked repository to your local machine and get busy!
